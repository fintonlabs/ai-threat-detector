## Project Overview

This project involves developing a lightweight, efficient yet powerful AI tool that leverages Python for analyzing network traffic. With the growing complexity and volume of cyber threats, this tool provides a proactive approach to detect potential security threats and intrusions. It processes network traffic data from different file formats, such as PCAP (Packet Capture) and CSV, and transforms it into a structured DataFrame for further analysis. This tool can be integrated within existing security infrastructure and can provide valuable insights to enhance network security.

## Project Features :star2:

- **Data Processing from PCAP** :open_file_folder: : The tool has the ability to read network traffic data from PCAP files. The `from_pcap` method extracts relevant information from each packet such as source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, protocol, and payload. This information is then structured into a Pandas DataFrame, providing a convenient data structure for further data analysis and manipulation.

- **Data Processing from CSV** :page_facing_up: : The tool's design is flexible and adaptable, being able to process data from different file formats, such as CSV. While the code for this function has not been provided, it is expected that it would behave similarly to the `from_pcap` method, converting data from a CSV file into a structured DataFrame.

- **Lightweight and Efficient** :rocket: : Designed with efficiency in mind, the tool utilises minimal computing resources. This makes it ideal for real-time data processing and threat detection, even in systems with high traffic volume.

- **AI-Driven Threat Detection** :gear: : Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, this tool can be trained to identify potential security threats and intrusions in the network data. This proactive approach can help thwart cyber attacks before they cause damage.

- **Integration Capabilities** :link: : The tool is designed to be easily integrated into existing network security infrastructure. Its outputs (Pandas DataFrames) can be easily used by other components of the system for further analysis, alerting, and response.

- **User-Friendly Data Structure** :busts_in_silhouette: : The tool structures the network traffic data into a user-friendly Pandas DataFrame, which is a widely-used data structure in data analysis. This provides a flexible and powerful interface for exploring and analyzing the data.

# Installation Instructions

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for installing and setting up the project, including the prerequisites, installation process, verification steps, and any post-installation configuration needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin with the installation process, you need to ensure that the following software and libraries are installed:

1. **Python**: Python 3.6 or higher is required for this project. Python can be downloaded and installed from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Pandas**: This is a powerful library for data handling and manipulation. You can install it using pip, Python's package installer.

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

3. **Scapy**: This Python program is used for packet manipulation. It can be installed via pip as follows:

    ```bash
    pip install scapy
    ```

## Installation Process

1. **Clone the project repository**: First, you need to clone the project from the GitHub repository. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Once the project is cloned, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

## Verification Steps

To ensure the project has been set up correctly and all dependencies are properly installed:

1. **Check Python version**: Run the following command to verify the Python version. It should be 3.6 or higher.

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

2. **Check Pandas and Scapy installation**: Run the following Python commands to verify the installation of Pandas and Scapy.

    ```python
    import pandas
    import scapy.all
    ```

   If these commands run without throwing any errors, it means that both libraries are installed correctly.

## Post-Installation Configuration

After the successful installation, you might need to configure the project according to your requirements. The main configuration could be the file paths from where the network traffic data is to be read. This can be done by changing the `file_path` input to the `from_pcap` and `from_csv` methods in the `DataProcessor` class.

**Note**: Make sure your PCAP and CSV files are accessible and have the correct permissions set. 

This concludes the installation and setup guide for the project. Happy coding!

## Project Documentation: Lightweight AI Tool for Network Traffic Analysis

### Basic Usage 

The primary usage of this tool involves analyzing network traffic data from different file formats. The tool currently supports PCAP and CSV file formats.

Here is a basic usage example with a PCAP file:

```python
from DataProcessor import DataProcessor

# Specify the path to your PCAP file
file_path = "/path/to/your/file.pcap"

# Use the from_pcap method to read the file and get a DataFrame
df = DataProcessor.from_pcap(file_path)

# Now you can use pandas methods on the DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

### Common Use Cases 

The main use case for this tool is to analyze network traffic data for potential security threats and intrusions. You can use it to process large amounts of network data and extract useful information such as source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, protocol, and payload.

For instance, to filter out TCP packets from a specific IP, you could do:

```python
# Assuming df is the Dataframe obtained from DataProcessor
tcp_packets = df[df['protocol'] == 'TCP']
specific_ip_packets = tcp_packets[tcp_packets['src_ip'] == '192.168.1.1']
```

### Command-line Arguments or Parameters 

The `from_pcap` method takes one parameter:

- `file_path`: A string that specifies the path to the PCAP file.

The method returns a pandas DataFrame containing the network traffic data.

### Expected Output 

The `from_pcap` method returns a pandas DataFrame. Each row in the DataFrame represents a single packet from the network traffic data, with the following columns: 'src_ip', 'dst_ip', 'src_port', 'dst_port', 'protocol', and 'payload'.

Here is an example of the expected output:

```
   src_ip        dst_ip  src_port  dst_port protocol                                            payload
0  192.168.1.1   192.168.1.2      12345      80      TCP  <Raw  load='\x17\x03\x03\x00\xfb\x00\x00\x00...
1  192.168.1.1   192.168.1.2      12345      80      TCP  <Raw  load='\x17\x03\x03\x00\xfb\x00\x00\x00...
...
```

### Advanced Usage Scenarios 

In more advanced scenarios, you might want to use this tool together with a machine learning model to predict potential network attacks. For instance, you could train a model on the DataFrame returned by the `from_pcap` method, using the 'payload' column as the feature and a manually labeled 'is_attack' column as the target.

Here is a brief example with a hypothetical model:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load your dataset
df = DataProcessor.from_pcap(file_path)

# Prepare your data
X = df['payload']
y = df['is_attack']  # Manually labeled

# Train your model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Now you can use the model to predict attacks on new data
new_data = DataProcessor.from_pcap(new_file_path)
predictions = model.predict(new_data['payload'])
```
