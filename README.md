# Project Overview

This project is a lightweight network traffic analysis tool that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect potential security threats and intrusions. It is built with Python and uses technologies such as Flask, SQLAlchemy, OAuth2, and Scikit-Learn. The tool continuously monitors network traffic, applying machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns that could indicate a security breach. This can be incredibly useful for businesses and organizations looking to enhance their network security and detect threats before they can cause significant damage.

# Features

- **Flask Web Application üåê**: The tool is designed as a Flask web application, a lightweight and flexible framework that allows for rapid development and easy scalability. It provides a robust foundation for our network traffic analysis tool.

- **PostgreSQL Database Integration üóÉÔ∏è**: The application is integrated with a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit and ORM. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of network traffic data and detected threats.

- **Database Migration Support üîÑ**: With Flask-Migrate, the tool supports database migration, allowing for seamless updates and changes to the database schema without the need to manually handle SQL scripts.

- **OAuth2 Provider üõ°Ô∏è**: The project includes an OAuth2 Provider for authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized users can access the tool and its data.

- **Network Traffic Analysis using pcapkit üìä**: The pcapkit library is used to extract network protocols and information from pcap files. This data is then processed and analyzed to find any potential threats or intrusions.

- **Machine Learning for Threat Detection ü§ñ**: Utilizing the Scikit-Learn library's Isolation Forest algorithm, the tool applies machine learning to the network traffic data to identify anomalies. This allows for highly accurate and efficient detection of potential security threats.

- **API Endpoints üîå**: The tool provides several API endpoints (`/start`, `/stop`, `/status`) which can be used to control the analysis process (start or stop the analysis) and retrieve the current status of the tool.

- **Threat and Analysis Models üìù**: There are two main models in the application, the Analysis model and the Threat model. The Analysis model keeps track of each network traffic analysis session, while the Threat model stores detected security threats.

Each feature contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of the tool, making it a comprehensive solution for network security monitoring and threat detection.

# Installation Instructions for Network Traffic Analysis Tool

This guide provides comprehensive installation instructions for our lightweight AI tool designed to analyze network traffic data and detect potential security threats and intrusions.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. PostgreSQL database server
3. pip (Python package installer)

The project also requires several Python libraries, including:

- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask-Migrate
- flask-oauthlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- pcapkit

## Installation Process

Follow these steps to install the project:

1. **Set up a Python virtual environment** (optional but recommended to avoid conflicts with other Python projects). Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

2. **Clone the project from GitHub** (or download the project zip file and extract it):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/network-analysis.git
cd network-analysis
```

3. **Install the required Python libraries**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should list all the required libraries for this project.

4. **Configure the PostgreSQL database**:

In the main project file, change the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` variable to match your PostgreSQL setup:

```python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname'
```

Replace `user`, `password`, and `dbname` with your PostgreSQL username, password, and database name, respectively.

## Verification Steps

To verify if the installation is successful, run the Flask server with the following command:

```bash
flask run
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:5000/status` in your web browser. If you see a status message, the installation has been successful.

## Post-Installation Configuration

Once the software is installed, you might need to adjust the parameters of the Isolation Forest model used for anomaly detection based on your specific use case. You can do this by modifying the model's settings in the code:

```python
model = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, max_samples='auto', contamination=float(0.1), max_features=1.0)
```

Each parameter has a specific role:

- `n_estimators` refers to the number of base estimators or trees in the ensemble,
- `max_samples` is the number of samples to draw while building the base estimators,
- `contamination` represents the proportion of outliers in the data set,
- `max_features` is the number of features to draw from the total features while building the base estimators. 

Please refer to the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html) for more details. 

Remember to restart the Flask server after making any changes to the code.

# Project Documentation: AI Tool for Network Traffic Analysis

This project provides a lightweight AI tool for analyzing network traffic data to detect potential security threats and intrusions. This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the tool. 

## 1. Basic Usage

Before starting the analysis, ensure the Flask app is running. This can be done by executing the main Python script where the Flask app is defined.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 1.1. Start Analysis

To start the network traffic analysis, make a POST request to the `/start` endpoint.

```python
import requests
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/start')
```

### 1.2. Stop Analysis

To stop the ongoing network traffic analysis, make a POST request to the `/stop` endpoint.

```python
import requests
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/stop')
```

### 1.3. Check Analysis Status

To check the status of the analysis, make a GET request to the `/status` endpoint.

```python
import requests
response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/status')
print(response.json())
```

## 2. Common Use Cases

The most common use case of this tool is to monitor network traffic for potential security threats or intrusions. For instance:

* Start the network traffic analysis every morning at 8 AM.
* Stop the network traffic analysis every evening at 5 PM.
* Check the status of the analysis at regular intervals to ensure it's running as expected.

## 3. Command-line Arguments

There are no command-line arguments available in this project. All interactions with the tool are done via API endpoints.

## 4. Expected Output

When you make a request to the `/start` or `/stop` endpoint, the expected response is a JSON object with a `message` field indicating the result of the operation.

```json
{
    "message": "Analysis started successfully."
}
```

When you make a request to the `/status` endpoint, the expected response is a JSON object with a `status` field indicating the current state of the analysis.

```json
{
    "status": "Running"
}
```

## 5. Advanced Usage

For advanced usage scenarios, you may want to integrate this tool into a larger system for automated network monitoring and threat detection. This can be done by programmatically triggering the start and stop of the analysis based on certain conditions, and by processing the analysis results to take appropriate actions on detected threats. 

Remember to secure your API endpoints, especially when deploying in a production environment. The provided `MyOAuth2Provider` class can be used to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for the API.
